# Was Not The Impostor

Based on the popular game Among Us, I used DNS wildcarding along with other network configurations to create a site where users could generate their own "eject screens". Simply head to [name].wasnottheimpostor.com to generate a new site.

This project statyed on the front page of the webdev subreddit for about a day, and has been one of my highest trafficked sites.

<ButtonContainer buttons={buttons} />
<SkillStack skills={addColorToSkills(tags)} />
