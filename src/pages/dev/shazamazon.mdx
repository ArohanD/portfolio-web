# Shazamazon

Shazamazon is a full stack item description page modeled after Amazon. It is composed of nine individually deployed micro-services that are stitched together in order to architect scalable components with separation of concerns. My major contributions to this project are as follows:

- Creating the reviews component - a component that has its own front-end, back-end and database to handle review display, review submission, and helpful demarcations. The component also features a profanity filter, is WAI-ARIA compliant for voice-reader access and communicates to other components as reviews are submitted.
- Scaled the Carousel to handle 10 million items and 1000 RPS by implementing load balancing across multiple server instances.
- Created a proxy to stitch all nine components together.
