  Usage and Update Instructions
</h1>

This is a Gatsby site built in React-Typescript. The site is delivered using Gatsby's Server-Side Rendering process. 

## ðŸš€ Quick start

### Install dependencies and launch

With the Gatsby CLI installed:

```
gatsby develop
```
Note that files (particularly images and linkedIn data) are missing from the repo. This is because of a) file size limitations and b) protecting original HQ images. Make sure these are present before develop starts else you may run into issues. Theoretically you can start with having just one image in `images/photography/[FOLDERNAME]/[image].jpg`.

You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).


## ðŸ’« Deploy

Deployment is handled on Netlify, but done locally through the Netlify CLI. Run the following script to be walked through the deploy process, with a preview deployment first:

```
yarn run deploy
```
